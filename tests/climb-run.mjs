/**
 * Does anybody actually get up these?
 *
 * `validate-climb.mjs` proves the geometry is inside the budget. This proves
 * something stronger and much less arguable: it runs the *real* `Player` — the
 * same class the game steps sixty times a second, with the same gravity, the
 * same air control, the same grip and the same stamina — against the real level
 * data, and searches for an input sequence that gets from each ledge to the
 * next one.
 *
 * It is a search rather than a single scripted attempt, because a jump taken at
 * exactly one moment either works or it never works, and a player who misses
 * simply tries again from slightly further back. So does this: it sweeps where
 * the penguin starts, when it leaves the ground and how long it holds the
 * button, and a step passes if *some* attempt lands. A step that survives none
 * of them is a step nobody can do.
 *
 * The penguin it drives owns nothing: no boots, no wings, no motor, no diamond
 * perk. Everything the shop sells can only make this easier.
