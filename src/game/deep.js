/**
 * Under-ice composition — the sea.
 *
 * The shelf asked "can I reach that". The mountain asked "how long can I hold
 * on". Neither question survives being asked a third time, so the sea asks the
 * one thing that has been true of this bird the whole game and never mattered
 * yet: **it cannot breathe down here.**
 *
 * Which is the inversion the chapter is built on. On the ice a penguin is a
 * comedian — short legs, no grip, every move an effort. In the water it is the
 * fastest thing for a hundred miles, and this chapter finally lets it go. It
 * does not take the speed away to make a level hard. It takes the air.
 *
 * A level is a corridor: sea ice overhead, seabed below, and a passable slot
 * between them that moves up and down. Two rules shape everything:
 *
 *   1. **Rising is slow and free, diving is quick and costs the button.** So
 *      distance and height are one budget, not two — `swimReach(scale, dy)`,
 *      the sea's version of the mountain's `reachAt`. A slot that is easy to
 *      hit from above is often impossible from below.
 *
 *   2. **A lungful is a distance.** `breathRange` turns the clock into
 *      pixels, and the composer refuses to put two holes in the ice further
 *      apart than a lungful can carry you, with margin.
